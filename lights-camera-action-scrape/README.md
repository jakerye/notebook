## Lights Camera Action! Scrape, explore, and model to predict Oscar winners & box office hits

Wednesday 9 a.m.–12:20 p.m. in Room 15

### Description
Using Jupyter notebooks, HTTP requests, BeautifulSoup, NumPy, Pandas, scikit learn, and matplotlib, you’ll predict whether a movie is likely to win an Oscar or be a box office hit. We’ll step through the creation of an effective dataset: asking a question your data can answer, writing a web scraper, and answering those questions using nothing but Python libraries and data from the Internet.

### Event Notes
- Jupyter Hub
- Observe correlations and liklihoods

- Be careful with scraping terms of service
- Good places to scrape
  - Wikipedia
- cykitlearn  great for general machine learning (but not deep) - just svm model
- tensorflow for deep learning
- karass (wrapper ontop of tensor flow) - lsvm model
